                <p>This unreal project is not a game it is a plugin for other developers to use in their unreal project. This project was created as part of my mechanics programming module in year three of my university course the aim of this module was to create a tool that could be used by other developers in their games. From working on my other projects I decided that a dialogue system tool would be a good idea as I had struggled to find resources when creating one for a unity project. This tool allows the developer to add a dialogue object to any actor within their game and then create a 2 way dialogue between the player and object through an editor utility widget this would then be set to each character and when interacted with in game the player would be able to start a dialogue with the character as this was my first time creating a plugin for other developers to use it can be a bit confusing to set up as some adjustments need to be made on the character to add an action mapping for the interaction but overall I was happy with the result. If I was to return to this I would recreate the way that the UI is created as the way it is presented right now conflicts with the engines layout. </p>
